# Heart-Disease-Predicting-ML-Model

# Problem:
World Health Organization has estimated 12 million deaths occur worldwide, every year due to Heart diseases.The early prognosis of cardiovascular diseases can aid in making decisions on lifestyle changes in high risk patients and in turn reduce the complications. This project intends to pinpoint the most relevant/risk factors of heart disease as well as predict the overall risk using logistic regression.


# Data Information

The dataset is already provided in the kaggle repository.


The dataset includes several demographic risk factors:-

1. Age : displays the age of the individual.
2. Sex : displays the gender of the individual using the following format : 1 = male 0 = female.
3. Chest-pain type : displays the type of chest-pain experienced by the individual using the following format : 0 = typical angina 1 = atypical angina 2 = non - anginal pain 3 = asymptotic
4. Resting Blood Pressure : displays the resting blood pressure value of an individual in mmHg (unit)
5. Serum Cholestrol : displays the serum cholestrol in mg/dl (unit)
6. Fasting Blood Sugar : compares the fasting blood sugar value of an individual with 120mg/dl. If fasting blood sugar > 120mg/dl then : 1 (true) else : 0 (false)
7. Resting ECG : 0 = normal 1 = having ST-T wave abnormality 2 = left ventricular hyperthrophy
8. Max heart rate achieved : displays the max heart rate achieved by an individual.
9. Exercise induced angina : 1 = yes 0 = no
10. ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest : displays the value which is integer or float.
11. Peak exercise ST segment : 1 = upsloping 2 = flat 3 = downsloping
12. Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy : displays the value as integer or float.
13. Thal : displays the thalassemia : 3 = normal 6 = fixed defect 7 = reversable defect
14. Diagnosis of heart disease : Displays whether the individual is suffering from heart disease or not : 0 = absence 1 = present.

# Technologies Used:
1. Pandas (for data manipulation)
2. Matplotlib (for data visualization)
3. Seaborn (for data visualization)
4. Scikit-Learn (for data modeling)
5. Python and Jupyter Notebook (for Implementation)
